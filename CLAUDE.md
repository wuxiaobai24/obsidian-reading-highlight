# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an Obsidian plugin called "Reading Highlight" that provides persistent text highlighting functionality across reading and source modes. The plugin uses Obsidian's native `==text==` syntax to store highlights directly in markdown files, ensuring seamless synchronization between modes. It features touch-optimized interactions for mobile devices and a modern, responsive design.

## Development Commands

- `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `npm run build` - Build the plugin (requires: `npx esbuild main.ts --bundle --outdir=. --format=cjs --platform=node --external:obsidian`)
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with file watching
- `npm run copy` - Copy built plugin to Obsidian vault

## Key Features

1. **Persistent Highlight Storage**: Uses `==text==` syntax to store highlights directly in markdown files
2. **Cross-Mode Synchronization**: Highlights seamlessly sync between reading and source modes
3. **Mobile-Optimized Interface**: Touch-friendly popup menus with large buttons and gesture support
4. **Desktop Experience**: Floating highlight button with modern gradient design
5. **File-Based Storage**: Highlights persist across plugin reloads and file relocations
6. **Customizable Appearance**: Adjustable highlight colors and opacity for reading mode display
7. **Obsidian Native Integration**: Leverages built-in `==text==` highlighting syntax

## Architecture

### Main Components

- `main.ts` - Core plugin implementation with:
  - `ReadingHighlightPlugin` class - Main plugin logic
  - `ReadingHighlightSettingTab` - Settings interface
  - File-based highlight management using `==text==` syntax
  - Dual input handling: mouse (desktop) and touch (mobile)
  - Direct file modification for persistent storage
  - Smart positioning for mobile highlight menus

- `manifest.json` - Plugin metadata and distribution info
- `styles.css` - Responsive styling with mobile-optimized animations
- `package.json` - Dependencies and build scripts
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration

### Source Files

- `main-real.ts` - Current implementation with persistent storage
- `main-simple.ts` - Simplified version for debugging
- `main-test.ts` - Basic testing version

### Mobile-Specific Features

- Touch-optimized popup menus with large buttons (44px minimum height)
- Smart menu positioning that avoids screen boundaries
- Gesture support with touch-action manipulation
- Responsive design with media queries for different screen sizes
- Native mobile animations and transitions
- Auto-dismiss on outside touch/click

### Settings Management

- Highlight color customization (affects reading mode display only)
- Opacity control (0.1-1.0) for reading mode highlights
- Toggle between button mode and direct highlighting
- Mobile-optimized settings interface

## Development Notes

### Core Architecture

1. **File-Based Storage**: Instead of in-memory storage, highlights are saved directly to markdown files using `==text==` syntax
2. **Direct File Modification**: Uses `app.vault.read()` and `app.vault.modify()` to persist highlights
3. **Cross-Platform Input**: Dual event handling for desktop (mouseup) and mobile (touchend) interactions
4. **Obsidian Integration**: Leverages native `==text==` syntax, ensuring compatibility with core features
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks for file operations and DOM manipulation

### Mobile Development Considerations

1. **Touch Event Handling**: Uses passive event listeners for better performance
2. **Smart Positioning**: Menus are positioned to avoid screen boundaries and device notches
3. **Responsive Design**: Media queries and touch-optimized CSS properties
4. **Gesture Support**: Implements touch-action manipulation for better touch response
5. **Performance**: Optimized for mobile devices with efficient event delegation

### Building and Deployment

The plugin uses ESBuild for fast TypeScript compilation and bundling. The `dev.js` utility handles automatic deployment to the Obsidian vault during development.

## User Experience

### Desktop Usage
1. Select any text in reading mode
2. Click the floating üñçÔ∏è button that appears
3. Text is immediately highlighted and saved as `==text==` in the file
4. Switch to source mode to see the persistent `==text==` markers

### Mobile Usage
1. Long-press text to enter selection mode
2. Drag handles to adjust selection range
3. Release to see the highlight menu popup
4. Tap "È´ò‰∫Æ" to highlight or "ÂèñÊ∂à" to dismiss
5. Menu is intelligently positioned to avoid screen edges

### Cross-Mode Sync
- **Reading Mode**: Shows colored highlights with customizable appearance
- **Source Mode**: Displays `==text==` syntax directly in markdown
- **Real-time Sync**: Changes in either mode are immediately reflected

## Plugin Deployment

The plugin is configured to automatically copy to the Obsidian vault at:
- **Vault Path**: `/mnt/c/Users/wuxiaobai24/test` (configurable via `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` env var)
- **Plugin Directory**: `.obsidian/plugins/reading-highlight`

Use `npm run copy` to deploy the plugin to your Obsidian vault after building.

## Testing

### Desktop Testing
1. **Development Mode**: Run `npm run dev` to start file watching and automatic building
2. **Manual Deployment**: Run `npm run copy` to copy built files to Obsidian
3. **In Obsidian**: Enable the plugin in Settings ‚Üí Community plugins ‚Üí Reading Highlight
4. **Test Features**:
   - Open any markdown file in reading mode
   - Select text and highlight using the floating button
   - Switch to source mode to verify `==text==` syntax
   - Test settings customization (colors, opacity)

### Mobile Testing
1. **Device Testing**: Test on actual mobile devices for touch interactions
2. **Responsive Design**: Verify menu positioning and button sizes
3. **Gesture Support**: Test touch selection and menu interactions
4. **Cross-Mode**: Verify highlights persist between reading and source modes

### Compatibility Testing
- **Obsidian Versions**: Test with minimum supported version (0.15.0+)
- **File Formats**: Test with various markdown file types
- **Special Characters**: Verify highlighting works with Unicode and special characters
- **Performance**: Test with large files and numerous highlights
